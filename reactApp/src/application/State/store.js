//store - is a redux object which helps us handle state changes
//reducer - is a function which works with switch case (for each action type) and updates the state
// for every change returns new state
//each component will have its respective reducer
//action - is the object a reducer accepts to create a new state
//action - object => action type (increment) ,payload (+5)

// Dispatcher <creates a pipeline of multiple actions and takes them to store/reducer>
// Store <collection of reducers/states and acts as parent of all react app components so that states can be accessed via props>
